      <h5>Abut me</h5>
      <p>
        My name is Kelvin Nguyen and I am a second semester student at Seneca's computer programming
        and analysis program. After graduating this program I am interested in working with
        databases or web development. Furthermore, I would also like to work in finTech or for the
        government. I am also a recent graduate from UTSG specializing in political science. In my
        free time I enjoy watching movies. My favorite movie is Blade Runner 2049.

        I picked this board game because it is an interesting twist to the average trivia board
        game. Not only do you need to be good at trivia you also need to be good at managing your
        chips. Furthermore, even if you don't know the answer to the question you can still win by
        placing bets.
