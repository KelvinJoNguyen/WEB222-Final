    review:
      "Super fun. But the facts seemed outdated and it wasn't quite as engaging because of that. Will possibly get a newer edition."

    review:
      "Great trivia style game that includes a bidding mechanic to make things interesting. Most of the questions will not be things that the average person will know the answer too which takes a lot of pressure off what could be a stressful style of game."

    review:
      "A great take on the trivia genre where you don't need to know the answers (indeed, are unlikely to know them), but rewards wisdom and thinking on the fly. Great party game for all ages. Be aware that the questions are very USA-centric."
