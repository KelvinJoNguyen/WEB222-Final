        <h5>History</h5>

        <h5>How To Play</h5>
        <p>
          The game is played in seven rounds. One trivia question is asked each round, and each
          player gives a numerical answer to every trivia question. Players simultaneously place
          their written answers to the trivia question on the betting mat, and then bet on the
          answer they believe is closest to the right answer but not over it. The house pays players
          who choose the correct answer based on the odds marked on the board. The player with the
          most chips after the seventh question is the winner.

        <h5>Tips & Tricks</h5>
        <p class="cardMiddleText3">
          Learn people's "tells." Who is demonstrating confidence in their answers? Are they writing
          down their answers quickly or slowly? Are they doubling down on their own answers when
          they are betting or are they hedging by betting on a spread?
        </p>
        <p class="cardMiddleText4">
          You should size your bets according to your conviction level. However, given that it's
          impossible to lose everything (risk of ruin is zero since you always retain your original
          2 chips), it makes sense to be more aggressive than traditional Kelly Betting. It is
          always possible to come back from "nothing" unlike in traditional investing/gambling.
        </p>
        <p class="cardMiddleText3">
          Once you see the range of values on the table, there may be "pockets" of value where a
          particular answer claims more power than others.
        </p>
        <p class="cardMiddleText4">
          It almost always makes sense to guess something that is slight under what your true guess
          is (to give yourself some margin of safety)
